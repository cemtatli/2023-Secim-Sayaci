<h1>🗳️ 2023 Seçim Sayacı</h1>
<p>Welcome to the "2023 Seçim Sayacı" repository.</p>

<h3>Only with React and Tailwind CSS (Material Tailwind) technology.</h3>
<p>I would design a counter site for the very important May 2023 elections to be held in Turkey. I added the questions and answers that should be known before the election as an information box.
 I used <a href="https://www.material-tailwind.com/" target="_blank">Material Tailwind</a> to design its interface.</p>

<h3>View and browse the design freely with the demo.</h3>
<p>I will share the demo link to see the design and browse comfortably. <a href="https://2023-secim-sayaci.vercel.app/" target="_blank">You can click me to see the demo.</a>
