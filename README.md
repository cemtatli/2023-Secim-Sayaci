# 🗳️ 2023 Seçim Sayacı 
Welcome to the "2023 Seçim Sayacı" repository.

### Built using React and Tailwind CSS (Material Tailwind) </h3>
I would design a counter site for the very important May 2023 elections to be held in Turkey. I added the questions and answers that should be known before the election as an information box.
 I used <a href="https://www.material-tailwind.com/" target="_blank">Material Tailwind</a> to design its interface.</p>
